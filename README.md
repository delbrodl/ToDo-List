# ToDo-List

Built a practical to-do list application to gain practice in using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. It was also my first exposure to using DOM manipulation and Event handlers.

Began by following along with the tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wCpkOk2uCg&t=3471s

Continued on by adding features such as a toggle button to show or hide completed tasks and pressing "enter" to add items, rather than just using a mouse click. Also gained practice with local storage in order to save to-do list items each time the site closed and re-opened. 

My continued goal is to use this template to create a a virtual bullet journal. Allowing users to create a customizable organizer - adding different sections, depending on the users needs to stay organized in daily life. I plan to do this using JavaScript templating.
